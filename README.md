# Face Detection Project

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for a face detection project using TensorFlow and Albumentations for image augmentation. The project is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Manual Split:** Guide on manually splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets.

### 2. Image Augmentation
- **Using Albumentations:** Steps to apply image augmentation on images and labels to enhance model robustness.

### 3. TensorFlow Dataset
- **Integration:** Instructions on loading augmented images and labels into TensorFlow datasets for model training.

### 4. Model Building and Evaluation
- **Deep Learning Model:** Building the model using TensorFlow's Functional API.
- **Custom Model Class:** Creating a custom model class for flexible model training and evaluation.
- **Performance Plotting:** Visualizing training performance for insight into the model's learning effectiveness.

### 5. Prediction
- **Making Predictions:** How to use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a practical approach to face detection, covering everything from data preparation to making predictions. It is designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of deep learning and computer vision.
